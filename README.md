# Player Character Series - Punch - Part 1 

Hey guys,

This is the starter project for my new video series going over various pieces of functionality of the player character.

This is first sample project from my video tutorial which you can find here: https://youtu.be/cWWuDf2ZUj0

This project is going to primarly go over adding in new animations to our player, binding them to input keys and then playing them back in various fun ways.

The master branch of this project is the starter while part1-end is the fininished lesson.

Hope this helps, Thanks.
